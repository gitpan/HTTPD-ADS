Revision history for Perl module WWW::APS

0.1 Thu Oct  2 11:09:05 2003
	- original version; created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker 0.32

0.2 Monday Oct 27 23:16 2003
	- Still some bugs but less. DefenseServer.pl now uses Net::IP::Route::Reject .
	- squaashed bug in LogReader.pl with regards to interface to HTTPD::Log::Filter
	- sockets approach to separating root/non-root is fragile. Considering rewrite
	- to make one program which runs as root , uses unnamed pipe and then forks.
0.3 Make things run again. 
0.4	Add testing for open proxy along with recording result of test in database.
	Since this code uses Class::Constructor and it was brain-damaged messing with the case of
	identifiers and the maintainer didn't fix his module in 3 months a corrected version of
	Class::Constructor is included in this distro. 
	Fixed up the tests to actually work.
0.5	HTTPD::Log::Filter sometimes sticks on the adjacnet field " -". Add code to ADS.pm to clean this up.
